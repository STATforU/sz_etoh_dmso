# Influence of two widely used solvents, ethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide, on human sperm parameters

The effect of increasing concentrations of ethanol or DMSO from 0 to 2% are explored. The goal is to determine if these solvent may be used in protocols to prepare samples without altering spermatozoa markedly.

The measured variables are:

-   total motility
-   progressive motility
-   capacitation (relative phosphotyrosine content)
-   acrosome integrity
-   vitality

Linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models was used.

Also, the effect of time on motility was studied.

The data are in Excel format in the `data` subdirectory. Analyses (Quarto files with .qmd extension that you can open with, e.g., RStudio, <https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/>) and reports they generate (PDF files) are in the `docs` subdirectory. If you do not know R or Quarto, you can read everything in the PDF files.
